The conntrack package is a network connection tracking tool that interacts with netfilter (Linux's built-in firewall system). It helps manage stateful packet filtering and connection tracking for NAT (Network Address Translation) and firewall rules.

Full Name: Connection Tracking Utility
Part of: netfilter/iptables framework in Linux
Command-line tool: conntrack
Kernel module: nf_conntrack

crictl is needed to interact with container runtimes (like containerd or CRI-O) in Kubernetes.
Minikube requires crictl when using the none driver because it directly runs Kubernetes processes on the host.

Since Minikube uses Docker as the container runtime, we must install cri-dockerd, which acts as an interface between Kubernetes and Docker.
Install cri-dockerd manually: https://mirantis.github.io/cri-dockerd/usage/install-manually/
